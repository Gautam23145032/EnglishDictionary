## 🧠 How It Works

### 1. Searching a Word
- User enters a word and presses `Enter`
- `https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/{word}` is called
- First result is parsed and displayed

### 2. Suggestions While Typing
- Every keystroke sends a request to:
  ```
  https://api.datamuse.com/sug?s={query}
  ```
- Top 5 suggestions are shown under the input

### 3. Synonyms Click
- Synonyms shown in blue/underlined
- Clicking any synonym triggers a new search

### 4. Pronunciation
- If `audio` URL is available, clicking the 🔊 icon plays it using the `Audio()` class

### 5. Random Words
- Clicking the 🎲 button calls:
  ```
  https://random-word-api.vercel.app/api?words=2
  ```
- Each word is then searched and displayed

### 6. Daily Notification
- On page load, checks `localStorage.wordDayDate`
- If not today:
  - Fetches 2 random words
  - Displays a `Notification`
  - Stores today’s date in `localStorage`
